/// A wrapper around two [Tokio channels](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.13.0/tokio/sync/index.html) to asynchronously control
/// proper application clean-up upon termination.
///
/// `ShutdownHandle` allows us to easily make sure everything is cleaned up
/// across different threads before terminating the running application.
///
/// This handle has no limitation to only be used for shutdown; on the contrary,
/// this is a multithreaded flag that allows signaling all related flags from
/// any related flag and has one master receiver waiting for all flags to signal
/// their tasks having been completed.
///
/// ## Cloning
/// Every thread/task running should own an instance of this struct. Passing
/// related handles across different threads is done by cloning one such handle.
///
/// As long as at least one handle is not dropped, the program will not
/// terminate until all handles are dropped and thus all tasks have ended.
